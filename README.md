# Testlink FckEditor Substitude

This is a little Project to convert the exported XML Testcase text to markdown
syntax to be easily edited. The edit Markdown text is then converted back to
HTML like it is generated by the testlink editors.

The resulting HTML can be than copied back into the XML. Finally reimport the XML
to testlink. This is a bit easier to edit existing tests, especially if you want to
use copy&paste a lot, which is a pain in the a.. in testlink.
